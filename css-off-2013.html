					<p id="feature-text">In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach Robinson created the world’s first photomontage by combining five different negatives to make one complete print of a young girl on her deathbed. “Fading Away”—Robinson’s first and most famous composite photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

					<p><strong>Italy</strong> penalizes illegal immigrants with a fine of €5,000-10,000 and allows immigration officials to detain them for up to 6 months.</p>
					<p><strong>Switzerland</strong> immediately deports all convicted criminals from other countries and potentially even their family members.</p>
					<p><strong>Australia</strong> detains all non-citizens without a valid visa.</p>
					<p><strong>Japan</strong> is allowed to pay $3,000 to each unemployed Latin American immigrant of Japanese descent and $2,000 to each of that unemployed worker’s family members to return to their country of origin.</p>
					<p>The <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> prohibits foreigners from engaging in any sort of labor union-like activity, resulting in harsh living conditions, 80-hour work weeks, back-breaking manual labor, and below-minimum-wage pay.</p>
